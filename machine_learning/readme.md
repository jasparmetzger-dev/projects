# Machine Learning Projects

This folder/branch contains machine learning projects focused on practical implementations, experiments, model development, and working with data. A focus on the math-side of ml will come in the form of from-the-ground-up projects using less libraries.

## Highlights
- Classical ML models and pipelines  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model evaluation and validation techniques  
- Examples include sentiment analysis, regression, classification, and more

## Structure
Each project typically has its own subfolder with source code, datasets, and notes.

## Usage
Run the provided scripts or notebooks to reproduce experiments or train models.
